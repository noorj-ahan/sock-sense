# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [tech]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Noorjahan A A ] - [MES COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]
- Member 2: [Aliya Najeeb A] - [MES COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY]

### Project Description
[SockSense is a fun, useless AI project that checks if your socks match using your webcam and randomly guesses which one smells bad. Built with Python, Flask, and OpenCV, it blends tech and humor in the most unnecessary way!
] 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People suffer daily trying to figure out if their socks are matching or if one smells worse than the other‚Ä¶ but tragically, there's no technology to help with this first-world, entirely imaginary crisis.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[SockSense uses AI and computer vision to detect if your socks match and guesses which one smells bad‚Äîbecause clearly, that‚Äôs what the world was missing. It solves nothing, but it does it brilliantly.
